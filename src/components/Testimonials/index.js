                <p>"UMass Amherst needed to dramatically increase its capacity for COVID-19 testing – requiring the creation of a new CLIA-approved clinical laboratory in about three months.  Achieving this goal would not have been possible without the expert and professional guidance of South Shore Laboratory Consultants (SSLC). </p>
	
	                <p>Joanne Lannon, Elizabeth Mullady, and Glenn Bouchie developed templates, provided continuous feedback, and spent significant time in the testing laboratory as this was being created to make sure the space and all associated paperwork were in compliance for a CLIA inspection. </p>
	
	                <p>  The laboratory passed its inspection with no deficiencies noted. We look forward to continuing our relationship with SSLC."</p>

                <p>"In late April/early May Northeastern University decided to set-up their own, MA licensed, CLIA certified COVID-19 testing lab.  In so doing, we brought on SSLC to help us with the process.</p>
	
	                <p>SSLC, Joanne, Liz, and Glenn, were a pleasure to work with, knowledgeable in all parts of the process, and provided the documents and guidance necessary to achieve our certification.  They were also great teachers for me during the process.  From start to finish we were licensed and CLIA certified in approximately 8 weeks and there is no way we could have done this without the help and guidance of the SSLC team.</p>
	
	                <p> I highly recommend their services to one and all."</p>

                <h6>Directory of Laboratory Operations</h6>
                <p>"We approached SSLC early in the process of setting up our CLIA laboratory to deliver our novel biomarker assay to market. While we had significant scientific expertise inhouse, we lacked clinical laboratory and regulatory experience. SSLC walked us through the process of setting up and certifying our CLIA laboratory. This included identifying CLIA roles which could be filled by personnel already on staff and those which required us to look outside of our company.</p>
	
	                <p>As a start-up company, time and money are critical to our success. By partnering with SSLC, we easily recouped our monetary investment and shaved months off of the timeline. Their SOP package not only was easy to customize but Glen was always available to answer questions as they arose and to review any SOP we needed.</p>
	
	                <p> One of the most significant payoffs of working with SSLC arose when we pivoted to COVID-19 testing just prior to opening our laboratory. SSLC provided the expertise we needed to execute the pivot and expedite our “go-live” timeline. Our partnership with South Shore Laboratory Consultants has proven to be one of the best investments we have made."</p>
